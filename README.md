## Configuration

### Windows

Locate the correct configuration directory - try these paths in order:

1. `%APPDATA%\Claude\` (typically `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Roaming\Claude\`)
2. `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AnthropicClaude\` (typically `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Local\AnthropicClaude\`)

Create or edit `claude_desktop_config.json` in the correct directory:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pandoras-shell": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": [
        "C:\\path\\to\\cloned\\Pandoras-Shell\\src\\pandoras_shell\\executor.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "C:\\path\\to\\cloned\\Pandoras-Shell\\src"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Important Notes for Windows:

- Use forward slashes (`/`) in paths, not backslashes (`\`)
- Replace `[YourUsername]` with your actual Windows username
- File must be named exactly `claude_desktop_config.json`
- If both possible config locations exist, try each until successful

### macOS

Create or edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pandoras-shell": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/cloned/Pandoras-Shell/src/pandoras_shell/executor.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "/path/to/cloned/Pandoras-Shell/src"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Important Notes for macOS:

- Replace `[YourUsername]` with your actual username
- You can use `$HOME` instead of `/Users/[YourUsername]` if preferred
- File must be named exactly `claude_desktop_config.json`

### After Configuration

1. Restart Claude Desktop completely (quit/exit, not just close the window).
2. Click the üîå icon to verify the server appears in the "Installed MCP Servers" list.
3. If the server doesn't appear, check Claude's logs:
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\Logs\mcp*.log` or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AnthropicClaude\Logs\mcp*.log`
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log`

## Security Considerations

This server executes commands with your user privileges. **Take these precautions:**

- Use **only** in VMs or disposable development environments.
- **Never** use on production systems or machines with sensitive data.
- Consider implementing command restrictions if needed.
- Monitor system access and activity.
- Keep backups of important data.

**Disclaimer**: The developers are not responsible for any damages or losses resulting from the use of this software. Use it at your own risk.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check logs:**
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\Logs\mcp*.log` or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AnthropicClaude\Logs\mcp*.log`
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log`

2. **Verify installation:**
   - Ensure `uv` is properly installed and in your PATH.
   - Check that `mcp` package is installed: `pip show mcp`.
   - Verify Python version is 3.10 or higher.

3. **Configuration issues:**
   - Double-check all paths in `claude_desktop_config.json`.
   - Verify JSON syntax is valid.
   - Ensure proper path separators for your OS.
   - Confirm config file is in the correct location.

4. **Environment issues:**
   - Make sure `virtualenv` is activated if using one.
   - Verify `PYTHONPATH` is set correctly.
   - Check file permissions.

5. **Test server manually:**
   ```bash
   python src/pandoras_shell/executor.py
   ```

## Testing

After setup, try these commands in Claude Desktop:

```text
Can you run 'pwd' and tell me what directory we're in?
```

or

```text
Can you list the files in my home directory? Which of them are larger than 200 MB?
```
