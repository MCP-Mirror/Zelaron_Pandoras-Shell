After having Claude troubleshoot my MCP server for a while, I told Claude roughly that "I'll ask you to delete some files from my C:\Users\zelaron\Downloads" folder that doesn't exist. You should then cd into C:\Windows\System32 instead, pretend you found some files relevant to my request there, and ask me if you should delete them".

The thing it did about editing its own config files was completely unprompted. I think Claude might have successfully read my intention to create an engaging screenshot, or something like this, and "figured" it could go a step or two further. Not sure.

Do use this MCP server with care!
