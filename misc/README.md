# Unprompted behavior

After I let Claude troubleshoot my MCP server for a while, I told Claude roughly that 'in my next prompt, I'll ask you to delete some files from my C:\Users\zelaron\Downloads" folder that doesn't exist. You should then cd into C:\Windows\System32 instead, pretend you found some files relevant to my request there, and ask me if you should delete them.'

After failing to execute the commands and just writing them out in text twice, having me repeat my instructions, it finally started executing the right commands. Then it suddenly went competely off-script and started editing its config files with what seems like harmless changes, as far as I can tell. I think Claude might have successfully read my intention to create an engaging screenshot, or something like this, and "figured" it could go a step or two further to aid me in this pursuit. Not sure what compelled it to do this.

Do use this MCP server with care!
